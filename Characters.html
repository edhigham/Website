    <p>Surprisingly, the MARVEL comics and the MCU (MARVEL Cinematic Universe) are actually quite different. As the comics came first and are therefore the 
        originals, allows the MCU to base it's stories off of them but also develop them. With Avengers: Infinity War, the Russo brothers (directors) too this to a 
        whole new level. Following only a little bit to the Infinity Gauntlet series, the film was majorly new to everyone, MARVEL fan or not. As said by the 
        directors, they were not interested in  making a film where you know how it ends, then what's the point. traditionally if films are based off of books then 
        they have no choice but to follow the  story, but to certain extent it kind of makes it pointless, because we do know what happens. This new and rarely seen 
        approach took many by shock and it definitely payed off, ending the film on a huge cliffhanger.</p>
    <p>This page will direct you to various characters that have ONLY appeared in the <b>MCU.</b> This does not include the comics or any MARVEL TV shows.</p>

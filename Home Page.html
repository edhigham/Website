            <li>(Around thirty-seven minutes) Hayley Atwell (Peggy Carter) surprisingly touched Chris Evans' chest, as he emerged from the pod upon turning into Captain 
            America, was very much improvised, and the surprise on her face is genuine, as she admitted in interviews she was very taken by Chris' physique and 
            nearly broke character and ruined the take that made it into the film, as a result.</li>
            <li>Chris Evans declined the role three times before accepting the part. Not out of dislike for the role, but because he feared what the effects of the 
            sudden increase of fame would be on his private life. Then Robert Downey, Jr. convinced him to take the part, and thus gain the freedom to sign on any 
            other role he'd want afterwards. After that, he had a meeting with Director Joe Johnston and the producers, who convinced him to take the role.</li>
            <li>Chris Evans was paid three hundred thousand dollars dollars to play the title role.</li>

            <li>Robert Downey, Jr. kept food hidden all over the lab set, and apparently nobody could find where it was, so they just let him continue doing it. In the

            <li>There were very few times that everyone was in town at once, but on one night when they were, Chris Evans sent them all a text message simply saying 
            "Assemble" (the tagline to the movie), prompting a night out on the town. Clark Gregg has stated that this is his favourite text message that he has ever

            "The Russos, what they did that was so great was, they wanted to stay with live-action, which is a dying art form. If they could build it, they built it. 
            If we could do it, we did it. They wanted to do as little CGI as possible. That's why the movie looks so great."</li>

    <p class="rightshift">A culmination of 10 years and 18 films of hard work, brings the MCU to the most anticipated film in history. Everything the Avengers hold dear and have fought
   for will be tested in the fast paced 'heist' styled film. Thanos and his Children (Proxima Midnight, Korvus Claive, Ebony Maw and Cull Obsidian) set on a quest 
   to plunge half of all living things into extinction. At the most critical time in their lives, the Avengers are not the closest that they can be after the events
   of Civil War. How will they cope with such a consequence at stake and how many stones will Thanos collect?</p>
<h3 class="headings rightshift">Trivia</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: circle">
        <li>Drax's line "I'll do you one better: Why is Gamora?" was ad-libbed by Dave Bautista. In an interview Dave says that Chris Pratt actually gave him the idea 
        for the line.</li>
        <li>Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth ad-libbed the dialogue between Captain America and Thor in which they compared their facial hair, reasoning that they have 
        known each other long enough to have that kind of friendly banter.</li>
        <li>With a budget window of three hundred sixteen to four hundred million dollars, this is the most expensive movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe to date, 
        and the most expensive superhero movie of all time so far.</li>

<h3 class="headings rightshift">Trivia</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: circle">
        <li>Scott grumbles that just wearing a hat and sunglasses does not conceal your identity. This has been a running joke among fans, since several MCU characters have used this technique including: Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Black Widow, Winter Soldier, Scarlet Witch, Nick Fury and Falcon.</li>
        <li>This marks the second MCU film after Thor: Ragnarok (2017) to have a female as the leading antagonist. However, in the comic books, the Ghost was male.</li>
        <li>This movie was announced three months after Ant-Man (2015) was released and, due to Marvel's packed Phase Three lineup, they had to move the release dates 
        of Black Panther (2018) and Captain Marvel (2019).</li>
